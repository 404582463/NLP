## What is this course about
Speech process is as important as text process.   
only 56% languages have written form(Ethnologue, 21st edition)  
we don't always know if the existing writing systems are widely used.

## Complex human language
1 second has 16k sample points and each point has 256 possible values.

## One slide for this course (6 kinds of processing)

Speech Recognition, Text-to-Speech Synthesis, Speech Separation/ Voice Conversion, Speaker Recognition/ Keyword Spotting(wake up words like "Hey siri"),  

## Speech recognition
traditional method: acoustic model + lexicon + language model

merit of DL models: compact size compared with traditional ones (80MB vs 2 GB)

## Text generation
Auto regressive/ Non-autoregressive  
Translation/ Summarization/ Chat-bot/ QA/ Sytactic Parsing

## Learning from unpaired data
Voice Conversion/ Summarization/ Unsupervised Translation/ Speech Recognition (all these tasks could be treated as a similar task as Image Style Transfer to change the style of certain object)
